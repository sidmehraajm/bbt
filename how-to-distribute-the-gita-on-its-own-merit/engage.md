**Timing the Donation Pitch**

* As you hand the book **back to them**, say:
  * “We don’t sell it like in a bookstore.”
* **Timing matters**: Say “We don’t sell it…” as the book is **mid-air** on its way to their hand.
  * This calms the mind and encourages them to accept it.

**Donation Explanation Script**

* Once they have the book, say:
  * “We don’t need the money.” (use hand gestures)
  * “The only reason we ask is that it’s an ancient tradition: when you give something in return for spiritual knowledge, it connects it to the previous teachers who passed it down for generations. It allows you to enter deeply into the knowledge.”
* Point to the book as you say this.\
  **Optional Donation Amount Guidance**
* You can offer a reference point:
  * “It costs $10 to print and ship. Anything you give over that is a donation.”
* **Benefits of this approach:**
  * Gives them a mental target.
  * Removes uncertainty: People often hesitate because they don’t know what’s appropriate to give.
  * Most will give around or above the amount mentioned.
* Alternatively, leave it completely open:
  * “Whatever you like.”\
