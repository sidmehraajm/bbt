# Qualify

**Start with where you’re from:**\
Say where you are from first (e.g., “California”).\
Then ask where they are from — it’s polite and engaging.

**Appreciate their origin:**\
Respond positively to their answer — every place is meaningful to its people.\
Example: “Illinois? Oh, I love Illinois — home of the Fighting Illini!”\


**Use appreciation as a segue:**\
After showing interest, connect it to why you’re approaching them. \
Example: “You’re from Illinois? Fantastic. I’ll show you one too.”\


**Key word — “Show”:**

* Use the word “show” instead of “give” or “sell.”
* “Show” is casual, non-threatening, and non-obligatory.
* Everyone enjoys showing and being shown things — it’s natural.\


**Summary idea:** Contextualize your approach with friendly connection and appreciation, then use “**show**” to engage.
