# BrainStorming

**Brainstorming creates synergy**, producing better results than individuals working alone.**Humans are natural idea generators**; brainstorming activates this creative potential.Solo as well as team Brainstorming is invaluable.\


Steps to Brainstorm:

* **Gather the group in a comfortable, peaceful environment** to encourage open participation.
* **Begin the session with a clear, focused question**, such as “How can we increase and improve book distribution?”
* **Write the question where everyone can see it**, like on a whiteboard or screen.
* **Encourage all participants to freely share ideas** without evaluating or analyzing them initially.
* **Have someone record every idea** shared to ensure nothing is missed.
* **After listing ideas, work together to prioritize them** based on relevance and impact.
* **Select the top 7–10** ideas to focus on as starting points.

**These key ideas become the foundation** for building a strong book distribution team.
