# Comebacks for Common Objections

* **“I already know about this.”**\
  Respond with humor and compliment:\
  “I could tell! That’s why I picked you. You look like someone who knows everything!”
* **“I’m a \[religion].**”Respect their belief:
  * Offer a different book more suited to their background.
  * If they **physically reject the book**, take it back gracefully – **don’t force it.**
  * Use aikido-like **approach: “Flow with them, not against.”**
* &#x20;    **They Say: Are you selling this**

&#x20; You say:We refuse to sell it.It’s too valuable.We just take a donation.

* &#x20;   **They Say: How much should I donate**
  * You say: We try to keep it under $100 (But in your case we are thinking to make an exception)
* **Use appreciation:**
  * “If more people like you were in the world, it’d be a better place.”\
