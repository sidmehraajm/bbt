# Compliment

Appreciate Their Response

* No matter what they say, **respond with enthusiasm:**\
  “Whoa, what a great explanation. I really like the way you put things.”\
  “If more people thought like you, the world would be a better place.”
* **Lean into the appreciation** — overdo it a little to make them feel valued.
* This energizes the interaction and builds trust and openness.
* Remember: They’re your guru now — they’re teaching you.

**Introduce the Karma Image**

* Say: “Generosity breeds generosity, violence breeds violence.”
* Show the **karma picture** (cow with man's head and vice versa).
* If it feels too intense or controversial, **you can skip this part.**
