# Trust the Hand

**Trust the hand:** People may hesitate mentally, but their hand often reaches out instinctively.\
**Hands have a natural reaction**: When something is offered, hands tend to grab it — it’s their dharma (natural duty).\
**Use this instinct**: Simply extend the book — don’t overthink it.

\
**Spiritual benefit:**

* The act purifies both the giver and receiver.
* It’s a meaningful exchange, not just physical.\


**Trust in the process:**

* Trust the hand will do its job.
* Trust Krishna — offering the book won’t lead to harm.
