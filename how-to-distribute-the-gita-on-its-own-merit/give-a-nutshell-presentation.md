# Give a Nutshell Presentation

**Give a Reason to Take the Book**

* People need a reason to accept the book — something their mind can agree with.
* Use a simple mantra:
  * “Books on yoga and meditation that show you how to get free from stress.” Practice the line so it flows naturally when handing the book over.

**Use of Questions: Questions are powerful tools** in conversation:

Visualize a question mark:

* Like a **hook** (draws the convo where you want). Like a **tennis racket** (hits the ball back into their court).

**Answer Questions with Questions**

* If asked something difficult or off-track, respond with:
  * “What do you mean by that?”\

* This puts the onus back on them and buys you time.\

* “You don’t look stressed, you look spiritual.”
