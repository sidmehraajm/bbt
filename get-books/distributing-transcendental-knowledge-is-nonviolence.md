# Distributing transcendental knowledge is nonviolence

#### • People suffer due to ignorance; providing spiritual knowledge is the cure.

#### • Just as a doctor must administer medicine to those suffering from disease, devotees must distribute books to those suffering in ignorance.

#### • Failing to distribute knowledge when given the chance is a form of violence.

#### • Śrīla Prabhupāda emphasized that enlightening others with spiritual truth is the highest form of compassion.

#### • Śrīla Prabhupāda dedicated his life to writing these books; distributing them is our service to him.

#### • Devotees who invest in books naturally develop creative ways to share them..
