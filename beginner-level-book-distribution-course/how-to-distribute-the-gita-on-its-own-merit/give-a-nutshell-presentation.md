# Give a Nutshell Presentation

**Give a Reason to Take the Book**

* People need a reason to accept the book — something their mind can agree with.
* Use a simple mantra:
  * “Books on yoga and meditation that show you how to get free from stress.” Practice the line so it flows naturally when handing the book over.

**Use of Questions: Questions are powerful tools** in conversation:

Visualize a question mark:

* Like a **hook** (draws the convo where you want). Like a **tennis racket** (hits the ball back into their court).

**Answer Questions with Questions**

* If asked something difficult or off-track, respond with:
  * “What do you mean by that?”
* This puts the onus back on them and buys you time.
* “You don’t look stressed, you look spiritual.”

**Effective Follow-up Question**

* After handing over the book, ask: “You’ve heard of stress before, right?”
* No matter their answer, respond warmly:
* “You don’t look stressed, you look spiritual.”
* Saying “You look spiritual” uplifts people instantly.
* Reminds them of their true spiritual nature.
* Simple affirmations can **transform a person’s mindset** on the spot.
* Positive words shape how people feel and respond.

**Most Powerful Question: “What’s your secret?”**

* Flips the dynamic —Ask :”What’s your secret?”.
* You become the submissive one, which makes them open up.

People give different responses based on their mindset:

* **Ignorance**: “I smoke weed.”
* **Passion**: “I work out daily.”
* **Goodness**: “I meditate/read Gita.”

If they say they don’t know, **suggest something positive:**

* “You must come from a good family.”
* “You must be a natural.”
