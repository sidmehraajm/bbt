# Radar-How to use your Hand Power

**Core idea**: Life is about response — you send a pulse, and get one back.

**Radar analogy:** Like a police radar gun detects speed, we can use a “radar” to detect ripe or unripe people.

**Hand power:** Holding up your right hand and saying “Hi” activates a beam (like radar) that detects a passerby's ripeness.

#### Detection method:

If someone smiles and says “Hi” back — they’re a **ripe fruit**. If they don’t respond — they’re **unripe**. If they half-respond — they’re **somewhere in between.**

**Crowds**: Don’t get overwhelmed; approach one person at a time with the “Hi” radar.

**Selection**: Conscious connection starts with the simple act of reaching out — “Hi. Hi. Hi.”
