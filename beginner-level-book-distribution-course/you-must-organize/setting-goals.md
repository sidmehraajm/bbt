# Setting Goals

#### After clarifying a mission, the next step is to set clear goals to achieve it. Śrīla Prabhupāda emphasized the importance of setting and increasing distribution goals.

#### The human mind has the ability to lock in on goals, similar to a heat-seeking missile.

Set both quantitative and qualitative goals for balanced growth.

* Quantitative: e.g., number of books distributed.
* Qualitative: e.g., improving presentation, learning new languages.

Goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, and time-bound (SMART).\
Deadlines energize efforts and provide momentum (weekly, monthly, yearly, long-term).
