# A Devotee’s Duty: Show the Books, Share the Message

#### If devotees don’t show Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books, who will?

* Making books visible is not difficult, but it requires initiative and effort.
* Following the third law of book distribution—“The More You Show, The More You Sell”—ensures that more people receive spiritual wisdom.
* Material products are marketed as sources of happiness, but true fulfillment comes from spiritual knowledge.
* Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books guide people to real, lasting happiness beyond material pursuits.
* The world is full of distractions; devotees must offer books as a genuine solution to people’s search for meaning.
* Even casual exposure to books can spark someone’s spiritual journey.
* Even when success seems slow, consistent efforts eventually bear fruit.
* Every effort to show books contributes to the mission, even if results are not immediate.
