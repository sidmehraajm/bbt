# Understand the principle that visibility increases the likelihood of distribution.

#### • The more people see Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books, the more likely they are to buy and read them.

#### • Kṛṣṇa states in Bhagavad-gītā (2.62) that attachment develops through contemplation; seeing books sparks contemplation, and thereafter, interest.

* Just like in advertising, making books visible sparks curiosity and attraction.

#### • If people don’t see the books, they won’t get the chance to be inspired by their content.

#### • Visibility naturally increases sales, whether for spiritual books or material goods.
