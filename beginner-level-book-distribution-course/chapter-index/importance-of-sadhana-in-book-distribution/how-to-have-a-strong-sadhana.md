# How to have a Strong Sadhana

#### 1. Wake up early (preferably **before 4:30 AM**)

* It is the best time for spiritual practice (Brahma Muhurta).
* Take a **cold shower** to refresh the body and mind.
* Begin your day with **chanting the Hare Krishna mantra** attentively.



#### **2. Chanting with Quality**

* Prioritize **japa (chanting on beads)**—aim for _**16 rounds of the Hare Krishna**_**&#x20;mantra** daily.
* Focus on **quality over quantity**—chant with attention and devotion.
* Avoid distractions while chanting; find a peaceful place.



#### 3. **Daily Reading of Scriptures**

* Study **Bhagavad-gita, Srimad Bhagavatam,** and other **Vaishnava texts**.
* Read at least **one verse a day** with purports.
* Take notes and reflect on key teachings.



#### 4. **Association with Devotees (Sadhu-sanga)**

* Spend time with spiritually strong people.
* Attend **temple programs, kirtans, and classes** regularly.
* Join a **Bhakti Vriksha** or **study group** for discussion.



#### **5. Regulated Lifestyle**

* Follow the **four regulative principles** (no meat-eating, no intoxication, no gambling, and no illicit sex).
* Maintain a simple and **service-oriented life.**
* Organize your time for **sadhana, service, work, and rest.**



#### **6. Engage in Seva (Devotional Service)**

* Serve through **temple activities, book distribution, cooking for devotees, or helping in outreach.**
* Use your talents in Krishna’s service (writing, music, preaching, organizing events).
* The more service you do, the stronger your sadhana becomes.



#### **7. Gratitude and Enthusiasm**

* Always remain **grateful to Srila Prabhupada and Krishna.**
* Cultivate **enthusiasm, patience, and determination** (utsāhān niścayād dhairyāt).
* Appreciate small progress and avoid discouragement.



#### **8. Taking Shelter of the Holy Name**

* Chanting is the **foundation**—always take shelter of the **Holy Name** in both hardship and success.
* Develop the mood of surrender **("Krishna, please engage me in Your service").**
* Chant one chapter of Bhagavad Gita a day, this is called CHAD. Prabhupada encouraged this many, many times in his instructions to his disciples and followers that you should chant at least one chapter of Bhagavad Gita every day. To join the world-wide **CHAD movement**, you can go to the website, **readchad.com**.\
