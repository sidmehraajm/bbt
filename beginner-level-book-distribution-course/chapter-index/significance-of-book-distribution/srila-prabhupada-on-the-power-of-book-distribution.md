### Srila Prabhupada emphasized:

* "Actually producing and distributing books is our most important engagement, all other engagements culminate in this one end — distribution of books."\
  <mark style="color:orange;">**(Letter to Tamala Krsna, July 27, 1973)**</mark>\

* “The temple is a base from which we send out our soldiers to fight with maya.” \
  “Fight with maya means to drop thousands and millions of books into the lap of the conditioned souls.” \
  <mark style="color:orange;">**(Letter to Ramesvara, Aug 3, 1973)**</mark>\

* Our main business is to distribute my books and people will come gradually. Everything should be done for that purpose."\
  <mark style="color:orange;">**(Letter to Ramesvara, Nov 7, 1976)**</mark>\

* “All the leaders should tax their brains for increasing the sales of our books.”\
  “If we simply rely on book distribution all our needs will be met.”\
  <mark style="color:orange;">**(Letter to Rupanuga, Jan 11, 1976)**</mark>\

* “Every railway servant should see to it that the wheels of the carriages must be moving always.”\
  “Similarly, all of us should see that our literatures are profusely distributed.”\
  <mark style="color:orange;">**(Letter to Karandhara, Oct 9, 1971)**</mark>\

* “Yes, that is our real mission. Yare dekha tare kaha ‘Krsna’-upadesa.”\
  <mark style="color:orange;">**(Discussions, June 2, 1977, Vrndavana)**</mark>\

* This is our greatest weapon. The more the books are distributed, the more the ignorance of the Age of Kali will be smashed.”\
  <mark style="color:orange;">**(Letter to Balavanta, Nov 23, 1976)**</mark>
