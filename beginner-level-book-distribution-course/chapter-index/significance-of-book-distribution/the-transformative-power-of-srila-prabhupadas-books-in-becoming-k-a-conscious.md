# The Transformative Power of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s Books in Becoming Kṛṣṇa Conscious

#### _<mark style="color:orange;">Kṛṣṇa Interacts with Us Through Scripture</mark>_

* Since conditioned souls cannot perceive Kṛṣṇa’s spiritual form, He manifests in various authorized forms, including the written word.
* Just as the Deity form of Kṛṣṇa is non-different from Him, so too is the scriptural avatāra in the form of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.

#### <mark style="color:orange;">Śrīla Prabhupāda’s Books as a Path to Spiritual Fulfillment</mark>

* By intimately connecting with Śrīla Prabhupāda’s transcendental books, one becomes purified, fulfilled, and genuinely happy.
* The feeling of incompleteness in life arises from a lack of complete knowledge about the _**Complete**_ _**Whole**_; these books supply that knowledge.

#### <mark style="color:orange;">The Impact of Presenting the Bhagavad-gītā As It Is</mark>

* Before Śrīla Prabhupāda’s movement, Bhagavad-gītā was known in the West but had no real transformative effect.
* Once it was presented through disciplic succession, many people around the world immediately attained deep spiritual realizations and became Kṛṣṇa conscious.

#### <mark style="color:orange;">The Ultimate Transformation</mark>

* The doubts of those who receive bonafide scriptures are cleared like clouds dissipating in the sun.
* As their ignorance fades, they naturally seek the company of devotees and embrace a life of devotion, thus experiencing true happiness and liberation.

#### <mark style="color:orange;">Distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda’s Books as a Service to Humanity</mark>

* Those who distribute these transcendental books offer others the opportunity to connect with the Absolute Truth.
* Recipients of this knowledge develop a relationship with Kṛṣṇa, experience spiritual joy, and gradually engage more and more in devotional service.
