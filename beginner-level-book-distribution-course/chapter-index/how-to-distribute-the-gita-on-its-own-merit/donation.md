# Donation

**Selling vs Donation**

* If asked, “Are you selling this?”
  * Say: “We **refuse** to sell it. It’s too valuable. We just accept donations.”
  * Add humor: “We try to keep it under $100… but in your case, we’re thinking about making an exception!”

**Handling “I don’t have cash”**

* Say:“Perfect. We don’t take cash. We take credit cards, Venmo, PayPal, everything!”
  * Often, people will suddenly “find” cash.

**The Penny Principle**

* If someone says they can’t give anything:
  * Say: “Just give a penny.”
  * This **lowers the barrier and opens their heart.**
  * Real-life story: Someone offered a penny, went to find one, wife saw the book, loved it—ended up donating **$50.**\
