Use Humor

* Ask: “What do you do professionally?”
* Show the image of the **yogi with the soul leaving the body.**
  * Say: “Really? This guy used to be a \[their profession].”\
    \

* Outcomes:
  * 50% will laugh.
  * 50% will say “Really?”, then you reply: “No, not really,” and they’ll laugh after.\
    \

* **Timing is key:** hand the book back **while they’re laughing** to create a positive emotional association.
