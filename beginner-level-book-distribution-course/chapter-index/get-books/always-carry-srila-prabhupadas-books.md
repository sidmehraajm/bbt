# Always carry Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books

• You can’t distribute books you don’t have!

• Having books on hand ensures you’re always prepared for distribution opportunities.

• Keeping books in your car, bag, or even a stroller transforms regular outings into spiritual service.

• If you don’t have books when you meet a receptive soul, you’ll feel the missed opportunity deeply.
