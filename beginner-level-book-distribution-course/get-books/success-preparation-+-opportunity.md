# Success = Preparation + Opportunity

#### • Book distribution happens when preparation (having books) meets opportunity (meeting a receptive person).

#### • Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books should be seen as essential equipment for any devotee.

#### • Even if you forget you have books, Lord Caitanya will arrange situations to remind you.

#### • As seen in real-life experiences, simply carrying books opens doors for profound distribution experiences.
