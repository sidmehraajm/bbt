# Understanding the Principle of Visibility in Book Distribution

#### • The more people see Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books, the more likely they are to buy and read them.

#### • Kṛṣṇa states in Bhagavad-gītā (2.62) that attachment develops through contemplation; seeing books increases interest.

#### • Just like in advertising, making books visible sparks curiosity and attraction.

#### • Visibility naturally increases sales, whether for spiritual books or material goods.
