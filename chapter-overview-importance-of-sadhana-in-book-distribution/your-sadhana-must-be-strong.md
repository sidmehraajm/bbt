# Your Sadhana Must Be Strong

* "Your sadhana must be strong." This is the genesis of our entire preaching movement. You cannot distribute what you don't have. Sadhana should be strict, serious, and sincere. If you make your sadhana strict, serious and sincere, then your entire life will blossom.&#x20;
* Strong sadhana produces taste. Without a taste, you won’t be able to practice Krishna consciousness long-term. Yet a devotee with even a molecule of taste can flood the whole world with Krishna consciousness.
* Taste is noticeable. When you distribute books people will notice you’ve found something that they inherently want. Then they’ll be open to hearing what you have to say as they’ll naturally wonder: “How can I get some of what that guy has?”
  * They’ll happily donate for the book seeing it as a valuable commodity through which they too can find happiness & satisfaction.

#### Summary:&#x20;

What you're distributing, actually, is the overflow of your own taste. If you get a taste by strict, serious and sincere sadhana, then you have something valuable to distribute, and people will feel that. Your taste will also propel you out the door as you’ll feel you just can’t wait to tell the world about the treasure you’ve found.\
