# Your Sadhana Must Be Strong

* "Your sadhana must be strong." This is the genesis of our entire preaching movement, because you can't distribute what you don't have. Sadhana should be strict, serious, and sincere. If you make your sadhana strict, serious and sincere, then your life will blossom.&#x20;
* Not only that, you'll get a taste. And you have to get a taste, otherwise you won't be able to practice Krishna consciousness, or anything else for that matter. So the taste is there. But it's just a matter of turning one's attention towards the holy names and towards the Srimad-Bhagavatam and the other practices of Krishna consciousness. And when you get a taste, even a molecule of taste, then you'll have an abundance of Krishna consciousness to spread all over your town. Actually, it'll go past your town. This is the tsunami. It'll go into your whole county, then into your state, then into your nation, and then go over the ocean and flood into other countries. It'll take over the whole world. One molecule of taste for chanting Hare Krishna is so powerful.
* So if you do have strict, serious and sincere sadhana, and you get a little taste, that's what people will notice when they look at you, when you distribute books. They'll say, "That person has a taste." Living entities know that. They know when someone else has a taste. And they're always looking around like, "How come that guy got something? How come I didn't get something?" And they'll see something in you and they'll say, "How can I get that also?" You say, "It's right in this book, just read it."&#x20;
* What we're distributing, actually, is the overflow of our own taste. If you get a taste, by strict, serious and sincere sadhana, then you have something to distribute. And when the devotees go out the door, frankly, they're being swept out the door by their overflow
