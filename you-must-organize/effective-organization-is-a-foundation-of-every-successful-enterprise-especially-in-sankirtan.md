# Effective Organization is a foundation of every successful enterprise,especially in Sankirtan

* **Organized communities sell significantly more of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books** compared to unorganized ones – by thousands or even tens of thousands.
* **Organization leads to both increased quantity and improved quality** in book distribution.
* **Lack of organization leads to stagnation**, with no measurable progress or improvement.
* **Setting goals and measuring results** are essential components of successful organization.
* **Disorganization breeds** stagnation and fading, while organization revitalizes teams and empowers consistent productivity.
* **Success attributed to organization, not luck** – consistent results seen in multiple communities worldwide.
* **Common excuse (“too busy to organize”) refuted** with the metaphor of sharpening the ax and quote from Brian Tracy: “Every minute you spend planning can save you five to ten minutes in execution.”
* **Śrīla Prabhupāda himself exemplified meticulous planning**, spending 69 years preparing for 12 years of explosive global outreach.

#### Concrete examples of dramatic increases in book distribution after organizing:

* ISKCON Toronto: 10,000 (2009) → 35,000 (2010)
* ISKCON Laguna Beach: 400 (2011) → 15,000 (2012)
* ISKCON Washington D.C.: 5,000 (2010) → 50,000 (2012)
* Team ISV: From dozens per month to tens of thousands over a decade.
