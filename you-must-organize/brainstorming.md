# Brainstorming

#### Brainstorming creates synergy and produces better results than individual contemplation. Humans are natural idea generators; brainstorming activates this creative potential.

Brainstorming Steps:

* Gather the group in a comfortable, peaceful environment to encourage open participation.
* Begin the session with a clear, focused question, such as “How can we increase and improve book distribution?”
* Write the question where everyone can see it, like on a whiteboard or screen.
* Encourage all participants to freely share ideas without evaluating or analyzing them initially.
* Have someone record every idea shared to ensure nothing is missed.
* After listing ideas, work together to prioritize them based on relevance and impact.
* Select the top 7–10 ideas to focus on as starting points.

These key ideas become the foundation for building a strong book distribution team.
