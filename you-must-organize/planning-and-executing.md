# Planning and Executing

* Following Mahāprabhu means to **"go, go, go, go"** — take action without delay.
* Start executing your plan **as soon as possible.**
* Focus on **improving along the way** rather than waiting for perfection.
* Progress through **continuous, active movement builds** momentum.
* With consistent effort and improvements, anyone can build a **strong book distribution network** (juggernaut).
* Incremental changes **trigger chain reactions of positive developments.**
* **Success is found in the margins** — winning often comes from tiny advantages (like photo finishes in races).
* In finance and life, **small gains compound over time,** producing large results.
* **Do what you can now**, even if you can't do it all — every small step keeps you on track.
* Seek out ways to **systematize improvements,** making progress sustainable and repeatable.
