# Main Objective in Book Distribution

#### Distributing books is a great honor and privilege. The primary goal is to leave everyone with a good impression — not just to distribute books. People will remember and talk about the experience they had with you.

* Always aim to make a positive, and lasting impact on each person.
* Proper mood and mindset are essential – both can be learned and cultivated.
* Gift something to everyone: a book, prasāda, the holy name, or simply a smile or kind word.

#### Benefits of the Right Mood

* Builds a positive image of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, one person at a time
* Keeps distributors focused on long-term spiritual goals
* Encourages ego-checking in favor of the greater mission
