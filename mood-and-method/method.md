# Method

#### Use scripture to bolster your distribution, read and hear from the books daily to present with realization and authenticity.

* Recite verses that directly address people’s objections (e.g., anti-organized religion).
* Presenting relevant verses helps both the distributor and the hearer.
* Scripture benefits everyone involved – the speaker, hearer, and the listener
* Turn impactful lines into sūtras (succinct, persuasive statements).
* Present books from personal appreciation, not mechanically.
