# Lord Caitanya arranges opportunities for book distribution

#### • Carrying books attracts divine arrangements where people are ready to receive them.

#### • Stories from devotees highlight how unplanned moments turn into major distribution opportunities.

#### • Kṛṣṇa directs wanderers toward devotional service, and devotees must be ready to facilitate this.

#### • The simple act of being prepared allows devotees to act as instruments in Lord Caitanya’s plan.

#### • Book distribution is not limited to formal settings; it can happen anywhere, even on a simple stroll.

#### • Carrying at least one book ensures that even casual walks or errands can become moments of mercy.
